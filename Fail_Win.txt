Confucius once said: "You sometimes win, and you often fail." I agree with this because Murphy's law says "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong." Therefore when something goes right for you, you should celebrate!
I tend to celebrate by eating food. Lots and lots of food. Food is the best. When you win at things, you should eat celbreat (celebrate/ate)
Even when things go wrong, I eat lots and lots of food. Food makes me feel better! There is nothing better than ice cream.

We learn a lot from failure, true.
But it hurts a lot, kangaro kick ado.
In the end, we pick ourselves up and keep going, coo?
