Confucius once said: "You sometimes win, and you often fail." I agree with this because Murphy's law says "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong." Therefore when something goes right for you, you should celebrate!
I tend to celebrate by eating food. Lots and lots of food. Food is the best. When you win at things, you should eat celbreat (celebrate/eat).
