Once upon a time there was an app named inventor.
This app could make other apps.
He made an app named Magic8Ball.
This Magic8Ball app could predict the future.
Ask it a question, and then shake the ball.
It will magically answer your question.
Sometimes it answers correctly!
Other times it fails...
I once asked the magic 8 ball if I could ever meet Orlando Bloom and get his autograph.
It said "Very doubtful."
Fortunately for myself, the 8 ball was wrong. I now have Orlando Bloom's autograph hanging on my wall *swoooonnnnnn*
