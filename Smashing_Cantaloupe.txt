Wreck-it-Ralph really liked to wreck things. He would demolish buildings, kick Lego sculptures and smash birthday cakes and this was all in a day's work. Ralph's particularly favorite thing to do however, was smashing cantaloupe. He enjoyed basking in the scent of the melons and feeling the soft, fleshy texture between his gargantuan fingers as he smashed the cantaloupe between his hands.
