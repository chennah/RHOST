There was an issue with the candle. It had a really bad smell. The monkey solved the issue by throwing the candle away. 
But the next day, the smell was back! Where was it coming from? The monkey just had to find out.

The monkey put on his detective hat and pulled out his detective magnifying glass and began the search. If he had alreadly thrown the candle away... where could it be coming from?

The monkey began his search in the basement.
