An orange in winter is quite a sad one. The cold weather preserves it, keeping it from spoiling. During the winter months, although cold and shivering, an Orange is able to survive for much longer than the summer months. This is the story about a young orange named Fluffy, quite an unfitting name for the poor orange. An orange is an orange is an orange. And Gertrude Stein writes some strange things. She was a better critic than writer, and knew them all from Hemingway and Picasso.
Fluffy was a rather peculiar orange as he acquired his name from a dark brown fluffy patch on his side. 
The winter months were not good to Fluffy. 
His owners forgot about him as he fell behind the refrigerator.
